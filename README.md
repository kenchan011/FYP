Results from cleaning raw data from GBIF and iDigBio using bdc package

Codes, cleaning reports and intermediate/resulting databases included

In summary, 4649/14847 records appear useful. Main problem seems to be records being labelled 'Heteroptera' or 'Miridae' with no lower generic/specific classification

Have not included the CoL data Prof Lim provided because I haven't figured out how to efficiently split the 'col.area' column in to countries/provinces/county etc, as some include multiple countries/localities.
